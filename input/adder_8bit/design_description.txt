Implement a module of an 8-bit adder with multiple bit-level adders in combinational logic. 
The module utilizes a series of bit-level adders (full adders) to perform the addition operation.

Module name:  
    adder_8bit               
Input ports:
    a[7:0]: 8-bit input operand A.
    b[7:0]: 8-bit input operand B.
    cin: Carry-in input.
Output ports:
    sum[7:0]: 8-bit output representing the sum of A and B.
    cout: Carry-out output.
